## Bug Fixes & Development Insights (October 26, 2025)

### **"From Build Errors to Production Ready: Fixing 69 ESLint Issues in a React TypeScript Project"**

**The Challenge**: After setting up ESLint and TypeScript strict checking, our travel planner project had 69 linting errors preventing successful builds.

**Key Fixes Applied**:

1. **React Hook Dependencies**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Before: Missing dependency
   const debouncedFetch = debounce(fetchSuggestions, 300);
   
   // ‚úÖ After: Proper useCallback with dependencies
   const debouncedFetch = useCallback(debounce(fetchSuggestions, 300), []);
   ```

2. **State Management Anti-patterns**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Before: setState in useEffect (cascading renders)
   useEffect(() => {
     if (value) setDate(dayjs(value).toDate());
   }, [value]);
   
   // ‚úÖ After: Derived state
   const date = value ? dayjs(value).toDate() : undefined;
   ```

3. **Missing React Imports**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Before: 'React' is not defined
   const Component = () => <div>Hello</div>;
   
   // ‚úÖ After: Proper import
   import React from "react";
   const Component = () => <div>Hello</div>;
   ```

4. **Impure Functions in Render**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Before: Math.random in useMemo
   const width = React.useMemo(() => {
     return `${Math.floor(Math.random() * 40) + 50}%`;
   }, []);
   
   // ‚úÖ After: Fixed value
   const width = React.useMemo(() => "70%", []);
   ```

5. **Unused Variables Strategy**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Before: Unused variables causing errors
   const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
   
   // ‚úÖ After: Prefix with underscore for intentionally unused
   const [_user, setUser] = useState(null);
   ```

**ESLint Configuration Insights**:
- Added Node.js globals for `process` and `__dirname`
- Configured `argsIgnorePattern: '^_'` for unused function parameters
- Separated JS/TS rules for better type checking

**Build Results**: 
- ‚ùå Before: 69 errors, 0 successful builds
- ‚úÖ After: 0 errors, successful production build

**Key Takeaways**:
- Always run ESLint during development, not just before deployment
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed to debounce utilities
- Avoid setState in useEffect - prefer derived state
- Prefix intentionally unused variables with underscore
